# ðŸŽ¨ Paint For Kids C++ Console APP

A fancy colorful application is an effective way to teach kids some computer skills.
Educational games are another enjoyable way for kids teaching. In this project (Paint for Kids) we are going to build a simple application that enables kids draw fancy shapes and also play some simple games with those shapes. Your application should help a kid draw a number of figures, fill them with different colors, save and load a graph, and so on. The application should provide a game playing mode to teach kids how to differentiate between figuresâ€™ types and colors.
